This is the beginning of my roman numeral / digit converter! 

This python file converts an input digit into the corresponding roman numeral, as well as a valid roman numeral into the corresponding digit.
This includes basic error checking, although more will need to be added to make it more complete in the future.

This took me about 3 hours in the first phase!

The .heic file are my "notes", although I didn't end up really writing anything important.
